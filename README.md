Co-authorship is appropriate if your paper benefits significantly from use of this model/code.
Citation is appropriate if use of this model/code has only a marginal impact on your work or if the work is a second generation application of the model/code.
Submitting bugs or science updates

If you find a bug, please report it to us (cwagner@g.harvard.edu) with the subject "MITgcm PCB model: bug report". We'll fix it, document it, and post corrected code online. If you'd like to submit a science update, please contact me (cwagner@g.harvard.edu) with the subject "MITgcm PCB model: science update". In the email, provide a quick description of the update and a copy of the journal article associated with the update. We will merge the update into the standard version of the code available online.

We're excited to include science updates from the community, but as a policy we will ONLY include work associated with a published/accepted manuscript. Thanks for your participation and interest!

## Software requirements

The PCB model is written in FORTRAN and runs on 96 cpus. It requires cloning the MITgcm eccov4 also located in the SunderlandLab repository first. You should then store this repository MITgcm_PCBs_pkg in MITgcm_eccov4_code/pkg.
